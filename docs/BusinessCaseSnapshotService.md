# BusinessCaseSnapshotService.cls

**Location:** `force-app/main/default/classes/BusinessCaseSnapshotService.cls`

## Purpose

This service class is the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) engine for the Business Case dashboard. It does two jobs in sequence:

1. **Assignment** — Links `Invoice_Line_Item__c` records to the correct `Business_Case__c` by matching the invoice's customer code and AG_OG code against the Business Case's machine installation data.
2. **Snapshot creation** — Creates monthly `Business_Case_Sales_Snapshot__c` records that denormalize all the data needed by the dashboard (sales figures, targets, margins, addresses, etc.) so the dashboard never queries live transactional tables.

Both jobs run for **Individual Business Cases** and **Master Business Cases** separately.

---

## Entry Point

```apex
BusinessCaseSnapshotService.processCompleteETL();
```

Called from the batch scheduler. Executes in this order:

| Step | Method | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1a | `assignBusinessCasesToInvoices()` | Assigns invoice line items → Individual BCs |
| 1b | `assignMasterBusinessCasesToInvoices()` | Assigns invoice line items → Master BCs |
| 2a | `processComprehensiveSnapshots()` | Launches `BusinessCaseSnapshotBatch` (batch size 20) |
| 2b | `processMasterComprehensiveSnapshots()` | Launches `BusinessCaseMasterSnapshotBatch` (batch size 4) |

Steps 2a/2b only kick off the batch jobs — actual snapshot processing happens inside those batch classes, which call back into this service's `processBatchSnapshots()` / `processMasterBatchSnapshots()`.

## Phase 1 — Invoice Assignment

### How matching works (Individual BCs)

**Source:** `Invoice_Line_Item__c` where `Business_Case__c = NULL` AND `DGroup__c = 'Reagent'` AND `Invoice_Value__c != NULL`

**Matching key built from:**
- `Invoice_Customer_Code__c` → must equal BC's `Machine_Installation__r.bill_to_account__r.SAP_Customer_Number__c`
- `AG_OG__c` field on the invoice → must **start with** `<SupplierCode>-<TechnologyCode>`
  - Supplier code = text before ` - ` in `Machine_Installation__r.Diagnostic_Machine__r.Vendor__c` (e.g. `"A - Boule"` → `"A"`)
  - Technology code = text before ` - ` in `Machine_Installation__r.Diagnostic_Machine__r.Technology__c` (e.g. `"HM - Hematology"` → `"HM"`)

**Example:** Invoice with `AG_OG__c = "A-HM-123"` and `Invoice_Customer_Code__c = "C1000"` matches a BC whose bill-to SAP number is `"C1000"` and whose machine is vendor `"A - Boule"` / technology `"HM - Hematology"`.

**BC filter:** `Is_Master__c = FALSE AND Master_Business_Case__c = NULL` + status contains New/Active/Revised

### How matching works (Master BCs)

Same logic but uses fields directly on the Master BC record:
- `Customer_Numbera__c` (note the custom field, not `Customer_Number__c`)
- `Vendor__c` and `Technologyaa__c` (direct fields, not from Machine Installation)
- `Material_Number__c` also queried (but not used in the matching pattern)

**BC filter:** `RecordType.Name = 'Master Business Case'` + status contains New/Active/Revised

> **Note:** `assignMasterBusinessCasesToInvoices()` contains a redundant SOQL query (`childbuinesscases` + the inline for-loop) that does nothing (the for-loop body is empty). This is dead code.

---

## Phase 2 — Snapshot Creation

The batch classes iterate over `Business_Case__c` records in chunks and call into this service.

### `processBatchSnapshots(List<Business_Case__c> businessCases)` — Individual BCs

For each batch of BCs:

1. Queries `Invoice_Line_Item__c` (Reagent, with date) to find all invoice months per BC.
2. For BCs with no invoices, calls `determineDefaultSnapshotMonth()` → uses `Agreement_Date__c` or falls back to `2024-04-01` (hardcoded historical default).
3. Queries existing `Business_Case_Sales_Snapshot__c` records to skip duplicates (key = `BCId_MonthFormatted`).
4. Calls three bulk helpers in one pass to avoid per-BC SOQL:
   - `bulkAggregateInvoiceData()` → monthly sales + invoice count per BC+Month
   - `bulkCalculateYTDSales()` → year-to-date sales per BC+Month
   - `bulkCalculateTotalSalesTillDate()` → cumulative sales since contract start per BC+Month
5. Calls `createSnapshotForBusinessCase()` for each new BC+Month combination.
6. Inserts via `Database.insert(list, false)` (partial success — failures logged, not thrown).

### `processMasterBatchSnapshots(List<Business_Case__c> businessCases)` — Master BCs

Same flow as above but:
- Filters the incoming list to only Masters that have child BCs (`Business_Cases__r` subquery not empty).
- Calls `createSnapshotForMasterBusinessCase()` instead.
- Uses `Sum_of_Monthly_Reagent_Commitment__c`, `Sum_of_Unit_Cost__c`, `Customer_Numbera__c`, `Customer_Namea__c` — the rollup/formula fields on Master BC.
- Reads vendor/technology/address from the **first child BC** (`Business_Cases__r[0]`), which can throw an index exception if the subquery returns nothing.

### Data Quality Score (Individual BC)

Starts at 100, deducts:
- -20 if `Customer_Number__c` blank
- -20 if `Supplier_Name__c` blank
- -20 if `Technology__c` blank
- -30 if no invoices in month
- -10 if `Monthly_Reagent_Commitment__c` null

## Inner Classes

```apex
public class InvoiceAggregationResult {
    public Decimal totalSales = 0;
    public Integer invoiceCount = 0;
}

public class InvoiceMonthData {
    public Date month;
    public Integer invoiceCount = 0;
    public Decimal totalSales = 0;
}
```

## Per-Customer Invoice Assignment

A second assignment path exists for targeting specific customers without running the full ETL.

### `assignInvoicesForCustomerList(List<String> customerCodes)`

Processes any number of customer codes in **3 SOQL queries total**:

1. Individual BCs where `Machine_Installation__r.bill_to_account__r.SAP_Customer_Number__c IN customerSet`
2. Master BCs where `Customer_Numbera__c IN customerSet`
3. Unassigned Reagent invoices where `Invoice_Customer_Code__c IN customerSet`

Builds two in-memory maps:
- `individualMap`: `customerCode → (AG_OG pattern → first Individual BC)`
- `masterMap`: `customerCode → (AG_OG pattern → first Master BC)`

For each unassigned invoice:
1. **Master BC wins** — if a Master BC exists for the matching customer + AG_OG pattern, the invoice is linked there.
2. **Standalone Individual BC** — only used when no Master BC matched. These are BCs with `Master_Business_Case__c = NULL`, mirroring the filter in `assignBusinessCasesToInvoices`.

> **Note (to verify in testing):** Each invoice is linked to exactly one BC — never simultaneously to both an Individual and a Master BC.

Returns `Map<String, Integer>` of `customerCode → invoices linked`.

### `assignInvoicesForCustomer(String customerCode)`

Thin wrapper — calls the list version with a single-element list.

### `assignInvoicesFromTrackingSheet()`

Hardcodes all 93 customer codes from  
`Imports/Tracking sheet for Reagent Rental of Machines - Mar 2026.xlsx` (Data sheet, column R)  
and delegates to `assignInvoicesForCustomerList`.

**How to run from Developer Console:**
```apex
Map<String, Integer> results = BusinessCaseSnapshotService.assignInvoicesFromTrackingSheet();
System.debug(results);
```

**Or for a single customer:**
```apex
Integer count = BusinessCaseSnapshotService.assignInvoicesForCustomer('3020000084');
System.debug('Invoices linked: ' + count);
```

## Important Caveats / Known Issues

1. **`Avg_YTD_Sales_Per_Month__c` uses the runtime month, not the snapshot month.** When backfilling historical snapshots, this field will be wrong.

2. **Master BC snapshot reads vendor/tech/address from `Business_Cases__r[0]`.** If a Master BC has no children in the subquery (or the subquery is not eager-loaded), this throws a `ListIndexOutOfBounds` exception. The try-catch in `processMasterBatchSnapshots` catches this and sets `snapshot = null`, so the snapshot is silently skipped.

3. **`determineDefaultSnapshotMonth` has a hardcoded fallback of `2024-04-01`.** This was intentional at implementation time ("most invoice data is from that timeframe") but will age out.

4. ~~`assignMasterBusinessCasesToInvoices` dead code~~ — removed in cleanup pass.

5. **Snapshots are only ever inserted, never updated.** The duplicate-check key (`BCId_MonthFormatted`) prevents re-creation, but if data changes (new invoices for an old month), the snapshot is stale unless manually deleted and re-run.

6. **`@TestVisible static Boolean forceException`** allows test classes to trigger the exception path in `processCompleteETL()`.
